# Q&A

**And where's the fun ?**

Then just don't use it ? I use it as a little help, and even with that, my friends are better than me. And it was mostly developed for fun.

**How to use it ?**

Just clone the repo and run `wordleCLI.py` with `python` on Windows and `python3` on Linux and Mac (tested with python 3.13 and 3.14).

**Wait, it's just for the French Wordle?!**

Yep, but you can very easily replace the `wordle.json` with only five-letter English words; there are repos with those JSON files. Oh, and make sure they are uppercase.
